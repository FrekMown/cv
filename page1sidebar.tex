\cvsection{Projects}

\cvproject{Web Development Workshop in India}
\begin{itemize}
  \item I taught a 28-hour workshop about frontend web technologies: HTML, CSS, JS and React to students from Mahindra Ecole Centrale in Hyderabad, India.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Structured Complex Scientific Data into SQL.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Parsed, structured and computed calculations from heterogenous experimental data (HPLC, mass spectrometry, gaz chromatography, ...) as well as DNA/Protein sequences.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

\cvproject{Development and Deployment of a Scientific Full-Stack Web Application}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The application simplifies the retrieving and visualisation of both experimental and theoretical data.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

\cvproject{Development of a Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis Pipeline.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Tool is capable of detecting relevant features (Machine Learning) and identifying them comparing fragmentation spectra from raw data and \textit{in-silico} spectrum prediction.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

\cvproject{Gene Research with Sequence Analysis and Chemoinformatics.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Several homologues with reinforced activity found in public and private databases using sequence comparison and chemoinformatics.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

% \cvproject{Creation of a Chemoinformatics Reactions Database and an Enzyme Promiscuity Prediction tool.}
% \begin{itemize}
% 	\item Biochemical reaction databases were fused with structural data from chemical databases. \textit{Atom-atom mapping} was computed in order to predict potential undesirable reactions.
% \end{itemize}
% \smallskip

\cvproject{Metabolic Network Modelling.}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Analysis of complex networks modelling the relations between genes, proteins, molecules and proteins inside the cell. Main conclusions led to publication of three patents.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

\cvproject{Transportation Network Modelling and Forecasting}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Creation and analysis of transportation networks holding geographical data for different transportation modes (train, cars, flights), as well as estimations of the current demand coming from polls and simulations.
\end{itemize}
\smallskip

% \cvproject{Macroeconomics Data Analysis and Forecasting.}
% \begin{itemize}
%     \item Publication of two documents in macroeconomics and public policies thanks to modelling, analysis and forecasting using macroeconomics data.
% \end{itemize}
